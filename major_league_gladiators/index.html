        Major League Gladiators is a 2-player co-op shooter for Virtual Reality.
        Players take control of two classes, facing off against waves of enemies in an arena.
        Players will have to attempt to survive as many waves of enemies as possible by synergistically using their abilities as well as keeping each otherâ€™s health and ammunition up.

        Major League Gladiators is the final project of students studying MultiMediaTechnology (MMT) at the FH Salzburg University of Applied Sciences.
        The game was created in cooperation with students of MultiMediaArt (MMA), who provide the graphic assets.
        I worked as a programmer focusing on multiplayer, weapons and abilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project started in January 2017 and was completed in June 2017. The game was developed with the Unreal Engine 4 using mostly C++.
        After finishing the project I worked together with two other members to publish the game on Steam as well as adding Oculus Rift Support and some small improvements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game is available on Steam for free (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/727310/Major_League_Gladiators/">Link</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/in0x/MajorLeagueGladiators">here</a>.
