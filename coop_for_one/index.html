        Coop for one is a Jump ’n’ Run Game for PC.
        Moving or jumping with one character influences the other character by half the amount. Gravity inverters and boosters also apply to both characters.
        To win both characters need to reach the end and must support each other along the way.
        It can be played by one player alone as well as by two players together, which share the keyboard.
        Both playstyles have their one advantages and disadvantages.        
        Two players can better focus on their character, but have a harder time coordinating their actions.
        For one player it is easier to coordinate both characters, but it is easier to get overwhelmed.

        Coop for one was created with a team of three of the MultiMediaTechnology (MMT) Bachelor course at the FH Salzburg University,
        with the support of one student of MultiMediaArt (MMA) for graphic assets. It was made during the 4th semester.
        I worked as a programmer, focusing on gameplay elements and level loading.

        The project was created with C++ using the <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SMFL</a> and <a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a>.
        The levels were created using the <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">Tiled Map Editor</a>.
        The project can be downloaded here: <a href="cfo_portable.zip">Download</a>
