        BattleSense is a Third Person Duelling Shooter, featuring unique weapons.
        In BattleSense shooting duels are not won by good reactions and aiming alone.
        Players need to predict their opponent during a battle and adapt to quick changes to come out on top.
        The time to kill is higher compared to other shooters, which gives more options for counter play.
        Surprising your opponents is not enough to defeat them.

        BattleSense was created with a team of five students, during the master's degree course Game Engineering and
        Simulation at UAS Technikum Wien.
        It was created with the Unreal Engine 4 mostly using C++.
        The team was led by me with the great support of another member. I was solely responsible network related
        programming and shared gameplay programming with another member.
        With my previous Unreal Engine experience, I was the main person for all Unreal Engine related questions.

        The project started in May 2018 and was finished in February 2019. We worked approximately three days per week on
        the project, while taking a break during summer.
