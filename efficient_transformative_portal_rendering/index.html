        Transformative portals are a special kind of portal that connects two arbitrary locations with each other.
        The connected location can be seen through a transformative portal. By traveling through the portal, the other location can be reached.
        Transformative portals allow for special gameplay mechanics in video games, seamless traversal between virtual worlds or can be used as locomotion technique for Virtual Reality applications.        
      </p>

      <p>
        In my thesis I focused on the rendering of such portals. I created a prototype to test a new approach.
        Previous works used a "depth-first" portal render order, which fully renders the contents of one portal, before rendering the rest of a scene.
        My approach uses "breadth-first" order, which has its own advantages and disadvantages. One main advantage is the possibility to use instanced rendering to reduce the amount of draw calls.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, the number of previously drawn portals can be found within a fragment shader. This works similar to an occlusion query.
        With this technique the number of drawn portals was reduced.         
      </p>

      <p>
        The prototype supports multiple transformative portals of arbitrary shape and is real-time capable
        Multiple portal recursions are rendered, and users can move around in the scene and through portals.
        The prototype was created using the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan Graphics API</a> and C++.
        The scenes were created using the <a href="www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal Engine 4</a> Editor and exported with a custom script.
